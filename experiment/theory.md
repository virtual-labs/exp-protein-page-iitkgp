## Objective 

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis is used to separate biomolecules based on their differential
electrophoretic mobility under a constant electric field due to differences in their mass. Among the different
types of PAGE, BN-PAGE (Blue native-PAGE) is used to study protein complexes in their native state. Here,
all the interactions between proteins in their folded form are retained. SDS-PAGE (Sodium dodecyl sulphate-
PAGE) is used to separate denatured proteins uniformly coated with the anionic detergent SDS so that all the
interacting monomers are separated and the electrophoretic mobility is influenced only by the mass of the
protein molecules.


## Theory

Electrophoresis is the process of migration of charged molecules to the oppositely charged electrodes under
the influence of an electric field. The velocity with which the charged particles migrate in a constant electric
field is termed electrophoretic mobility (μ). This rate of migration depends on the intrinsic properties like net
charge (q), shape and size of the biomolecule, and external parameters like the voltage gradient of the electric
field (E), and resistance offered by the medium in the form of friction (f).

$$ \mu = \frac{v}{E} =\frac{q}{f}$$



Proteins are made of amino acids that have –COO and –NH2 groups and side chains that assume charge at
different pH. Other than their isoelectric point (or pH at which the net charge is 0), proteins are charged
molecules and undergo migration towards the oppositely charged electrodes in an electric field. This is the
principle of gel electrophoresis to separate protein molecules with differential charge/mass.  

Electrophoresis using gels made from a polymer of acrylamide, cross-linked by bisacrylamide (in the ratio
29:1) is referred to as Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). These gels are chemically inert and stable.
The co-polymerization of acrylamide monomers with cross-linking reagent N-N’-methylene bisacrylamide
gives a clear transparent gel with pores. This polymerization process is a free radical catalysis initiated by
Ammonium persulfate (APS) and catalyzed by N, N, N’N’-Tetramethylenediamine (TEMED) (Figure 1).
TEMED speeds up the decomposition of the persulfate ion to give a free radical.

The overall mobility of the protein samples in the polyacrylamide gel is proportional to the pore size, which
is a function of the concentration of acrylamide (%T) as well as that of bisacrylamide (%C). The pore size
decreases with an increase in the acrylamide content (%T). Based on the molecular weight of the proteins to
be analysed, gels of varying acrylamide content (hence different pore size) are used.

### Types of PAGE
PAGE can be performed in reducing (with the anionic detergent SDS) or non-reducing conditions. In native
or non-denaturing gel electrophoresis SDS is not used and the proteins retain their native structure and
enzymatic activity. Here, the separation of proteins is influenced by its the net charge, shape, and size. SDSPAGE,
on the other hand, is the most widely used gel electrophoretic technique where SDS strongly binds to
the protein samples and impart a uniform negative charge so that the separation is purely based on the
differences in mass. SDS binds to the hydrophobic regions disrupts all the interactions in the folded protein,
unfolds and linearizes it by binding at intervals of every 2 residues. The reducing agents Beta-mercaptoethanol
or dithiotritol (DTT) helps to break disulphide (-S-S-) linkages in the protein. So, in the gel monomers are
seen as distinct bands corresponding to their molecular weights (Figure 2).

The molecular weights of the protein samples can be determined from their relative mobility (as shown in
Figure 3) using SDS-PAGE.

### SDS-PAGE is a discontinuous gel system
To improve the resolution, a discontinuous system of stacking and resolving gel is used. The stacking gel
concentrates all the protein samples into a single band before entering into the resolving gel where the
separation begins. The differences between the ionic strength and pH of the buffers render different
properties to the stacking and resolving gels. The former has high porosity and a Tris-Cl buffer pH of 6.8,
the latter has smaller pores and a Tris-Cl buffer pH of 8.8 (Figure 4).

At the stacking gel, the counter ion (glycine) remains neutral (zwitter ion), and chloride ions act as the
principal current carriers and migrate towards the anode. The negatively charged SDS-protein complexes are
stacked as a thin band between glycine and chloride ions. In the resolving gel, glycine forms glycinate ions
and follows the chloride ions, the SDS-protein molecules are well resolved by the molecular sieving effect
of the pores based on their size difference.  

For visualization, Bromophenol blue and Xylene Cyanol are used to track the progress of the electrophoretic
process. Coomassie brilliant blue staining and Silver staining (for 100 times better sensitivity) are used for
final visualization. Coomassie stain preferably binds to the basic residues in a protein like Histidine, Lysine
and Arginine to form a protein-dye complex. In silver staining, silver ions are reduced to metallic silver at
sites occupied by the proteins based on differences in the redox potential.
