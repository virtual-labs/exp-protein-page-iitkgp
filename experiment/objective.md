## Objective 

Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis is used to separate biomolecules based on their differential
electrophoretic mobility under a constant electric field due to differences in their mass and charge properties. Amongst the different
types of PAGE, BN-PAGE (Blue native-PAGE) is widely used to study protein complexes in their native state. Here,
all the interactions between constituent amino acid residues are retained and the proteins are studied in their folded state.. SDS-PAGE (Sodium dodecyl sulphate-
PAGE) is used to separate denatured proteins uniformly coated with the anionic detergent SDS so that all the
interacting monomers are separated and the electrophoretic mobility is influenced only by the mass of the
protein molecules.
